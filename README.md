   1. Make Admin account
 	
For creating admin, locate to the project folder src/ directory, activate the virtual environment:

- For Linux/macOS : `source env/bin/activate.sh`

- For Windows: `env\Script\activate` 

Create a super user using the command, `python manage.py createsuperuser`.

Add your credentials like email, name, password in there and there is the Admin created.

If this doesn't work, use `winpty python manage.py createsuperuser`.

Navigate to the `127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and enter the same credentials as used for creating the admin.

   2. Google App Password
        
This should be a must for sending mails from this app, before creating a account, plaease create a app password on Google.

The sender's email must be a Gmail account.  The 2FA should be enabled on this account. You will have to create an app on your Gmail id that will handle the email sending, permissions, and the rest of the stuff for you. It's quite simple to do that, visit the [Google App Password page](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords). 

1. Log in with your credentials from the above link
2. Create an App  category-> Other give it any name(call it anything you like eg. djangomail, emns)
3. Now copy the password and store it securely somewhere.	

   3. Login
 
Creating Account with `Email`, `Username`, `Password` and `Google App Password`.

Once signed/logged in, that same email will be used for sending emails, it avoids spaming and mismatched email delivery.
